# Contact Management System

This project aims to implement a simple contact management system using Java, MySQL, and JDBC. The system allows users to add, search, list, and remove contacts from a MySQL database. It also enables filtered searches by name, phone number, or email.

I am always looking to improve my skills, so any feedback on the project, code, architecture, or best practices is greatly appreciated! If you would like to contribute with suggestions, you can:
